ARCHITECTURE

    This is an 8 bit CPU with 64Kb of memory, with data stored in little endian.

    The memory is divided in two parts, stack memory, and usable memory. 
    Stack memory is only a byte long, from address 0x0000 to 0x00FF. 
    The rest of memory is usable memory.
    The reset location is immediately after the the stack memory, or address 0x0100.

REGISTERS

    Program Counter (PC). This is a 2 byte, 16 bit, register.
    The value is automatically updated as instructions are being executed, or
        can be updated manually via a jump command.

    Stack Pointer (SP). This a 1 byte, 8 bit, register.
    Stores the next free location on the stack.
    Stack location is fixed and cannot be moved.
    Because its range is from 0x0000 to 0x00FF, only a byte is needed to store address.

    General Registers (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H). These are all 8 bit registers.
    There are no accumulator registers. 

    Processor Flags (PF). For the sake of simplicity, this register is 1 byte, 8 bits, long.
    There are only 4 flags, whose values are stored in the lower 4 bits of the register.
    In order of LSB to MSB, 
    Carry Flag (CF), Zero Flag, (ZF), Overflow Flag (OF), and Sign Flag (SF). 
        CF is set if last operation causes 1. overflow from bit 7, or 2. undeflow from bit 0.
        ZF is set if result of last operation was a 0.
        OF is set if result yielded invalid 2's complement result. 
            Determined by looking at carry bits between bits 6 and 7 and bit 7 and carry flag.
        SF is set if the last operation set bit 7 to a one. 

INSTRUCTIONS

    There 35 mnemonics, and a total of 43 instructions. 
    All but the stack instructions are general because of the amount of general registers.
