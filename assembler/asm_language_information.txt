The syntax to create an array is show below
$a [10] {0, 1, ...}
{0, 1, ...} is optional

To access an element in an array, an offset instruction has to be used. An offset intstruction is one grabs the base address from its operands, and adds to it by an offset stored
in register F.

Subroutines must ALWAYS appear before the main code. The loader will keep track of the main code by storing the address to the first instruction that comes after a subroutine.
The programmer is responsible of making sure the correct address is read from the stack when returning from a subroutine.
