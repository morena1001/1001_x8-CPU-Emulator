command to execute assembler from root directory:

cd assembler ; ./asm file_name ; cd ..

will execute assembler in another directory, but bring you back to the root directory

IF ON WINDOWS

create a variable in powershell to store command and use Invoke-Expression command on it

$prog = "cd .. DIRECTORY ; ./EXE_NAME; cd .."
Invoke-Expression $prog



To execute CPU, a .output file is needed, which is created by the assembler. 
There are also 4 flags that may be set for the CPU, -r, -m, -o, and -c.

-r output the contents of the registers at the end of the program.
-m output the contents of memory at the end of the program.
-o output the contents of memory into a .txt file instead of the console
-c splits the memory into chunks so that it is easier to look at the stack memory, ROM, variable memory, and so on.

If all flags are specified, the command to run CPU given the file sample_program.output is : 
./emulator sample_program.output -r -main

The position of the flags and the file do not matter, so long as they are behind the ./emulator.
