command to execute assembler from root directory:

cd assembler ; ./asm file_name ; cd ..

will execute assembler in another directory, but bring you back to the root directory

IF ON WINDOWS

create a variable in powershell to store command and use Invoke-Expression command on it

$prog = "cd .. DIRECTORY ; ./EXE_NAME; cd .."
Invoke-Expression $prog



To execute CPU, a .output file is needed, which is created by the assembler. 
There are also two flags that may be set for the CPU, -r and -m.

-r output the contents of the registers at the end of the program.
-m output the contents of memory at the end of the program.
-o output the contents of memory into a .txt file instead of the console

If all flags are specified, the command to run CPU given the file sample_program.output is : 
./emulator sample_program.output -r -main

The position of the flags and the file do not matter, so long as they are behind the ./emulator.
